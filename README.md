# Hadoop-MapReduce

This is my Cloud Computing Coursework repo.

The java class TriGramCounter.java needs to be run inside of a configured hadoop environment

The purpose of this project is to develop a 3-gram counter for example a sample of text:
‘How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?’

In 3-gram format:
'How can a, can a clam, a clam cram, clam cram in, cram in a, in a clean, a clean cream, clean cream can'

Then the occurences of each 3-gram is counted and outputted:
{{How can a, 1}, {can a clam, 1}, {a clam cram, 1}, {clam cram in, 1}, {cram in a, 1}, {in a clean, 1}, {a clean cream, 1}, {clean cream can, 1}}
